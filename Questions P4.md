   - Very Clear

3. **Did you encounter any challenges while using raw pointers? Please describe them.**
    *Open-Ended Response*

   It was difficult to track all allocations and deallocations, which sometimes led to confusion about ownership.

------

1. **Did you encounter any challenges while using smart pointers? Please describe them.**
    *Open-Ended Response*

   Integrating smart pointers with existing code that used raw pointers caused some compatibility issues.

------

1. **How did using smart pointers impact your task completion time compared to using raw pointers?**
   - Significantly Increased Time
   - Somewhat Increased Time
   - No Change
   - Somewhat Decreased Time x
   - Significantly Decreased Time
2. **How did using smart pointers impact the number of memory-related errors (e.g., memory leaks, dangling pointers) in your code compared to using raw pointers?**
   - Significantly Increased Errors
   - Somewhat Increased Errors
   - No Change
   - Somewhat Decreased Errors x
   - Significantly Decreased Errors

------

## Section 3: Comparative Feedback

1. **Which memory management method did you find easier to use?**

   - Raw Pointers
   - Smart Pointers x
   - No Preference

2. **Which memory management method do you believe reduces the likelihood of memory-related errors?**

   - Raw Pointers
   - Smart Pointers x
   - No Difference

3. **Which memory management method do you feel enhances code readability and maintainability?**

   - Raw Pointers
   - Smart Pointers x
   - No Difference

4. **Do you prefer using smart pointers over raw pointers? Why or why not?**
    *Open-Ended Response*

   Yes, smart pointers automate memory management, which minimizes errors and simplifies the codebase.

------

1. **What do you think are the main advantages of using smart pointers in C++?**
    *Open-Ended Response*

   They provide automatic memory management, reduce the risk of leaks, and improve code safety.

------

1. **What improvements, if any, would you suggest for the smart pointer implementation in this experiment?**
    *Open-Ended Response*

   Introducing a section on best practices for using different types of smart pointers would be beneficial.

------

## Section 4: Additional Comments

1. **Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with raw pointers or smart pointers in this experiment?**
    *Open-Ended Response*

   While smart pointers are powerful, a deeper understanding of their internal workings can help in leveraging their full potential.
