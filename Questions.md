# Explanation

The questionnaire is structured to capture comprehensive qualitative data from participants regarding their experiences with raw pointers and smart pointers in C++. It includes:

1. **General Experience:** Questions to gauge overall feelings and confidence levels with each memory management method.
2. **Task-Specific Questions:** Focused inquiries about the clarity of instructions, challenges faced, and impacts on task completion and error rates.
3. **Comparative Feedback:** Direct comparisons between raw and smart pointers, preferences, perceived advantages, and suggestions for improvement.
4. **Additional Comments:** An open space for any other feedback not covered by previous questions.

This structure ensures that the collected data will provide deep insights into the participants' experiences, preferences, and challenges, which are essential for evaluating the impact of smart pointers on productivity and code safety.

# How to Use This Questionnaire

1. **Distribute the Questionnaire:** Provide the questionnaire to participants after they have completed the implementation tasks.
2. **Collect Responses:** Ensure that responses are collected in a consistent format, whether digitally or on paper.
3. **Analyze Data:** Use qualitative analysis methods to identify common themes, challenges, and preferences among participants.
4. **Report Findings:** Summarize the insights gained to evaluate the effectiveness of smart pointers versus raw pointers in the experiment.
